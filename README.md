# AI Security Rules for IDE & Agent Workflows

**TL;DR:** Threat-driven rules that aims to make AI-generated code **secure by default**. Small, actionable, and enforced right in your IDE/agent.

**Disclaimer:** This is part of a defence-in-depth approach and does not guarantee secure code.

## What

* Rules translate real threats into **do/donâ€™t** instructions the AI follows while scaffolding, autocomplete, and edits.

## Why

* **Shift left:** Secure code at generation time.
* **Scale expertise:** Security patterns reused.
* **Cleaner reviews:** Rules also nudge towards easier to read and maintainable code.

## Getting Started

Copy over the relevant rules to your IDE/agent's rule bundle e.g. `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.windsurfrules` etc.
